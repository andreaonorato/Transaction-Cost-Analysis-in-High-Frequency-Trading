ðŸ“… Week 1: Dataset Collection & Preprocessing
Goal: Find and prepare the dataset(s) for analysis.

Day 1â€“2: Dataset Identification
    Centralized Dataset:
        âœ… NASDAQ Nordic dataset (Ntakaris et al.)
        âœ… NYSE TAQ (if access is feasible)
    Decentralized Dataset:
        âœ… Uniswap/SushiSwap transaction datasets from Kaggle or public blockchain APIs (e.g., Etherscan API, Dune Analytics).
Deliverables:
    Links to selected datasets.
    Initial inspection of datasets (data types, size, structure).
Tools: web3.py for blockchain data we can look it up if we want.

Day 3â€“5: Data Preprocessing
    Standardize Data: Align columns (timestamps, trade volume, prices, fees).
    Filter Data: Remove anomalies and outliers.
    Active vs Passive Labels: Define thresholds for active and passive trades.
    Dataset Documentation: Document preprocessing steps.
Deliverables:
    Cleaned dataset(s) ready for analysis.
    Data preprocessing script.

ðŸ“… Week 2: Analysis & Modeling
Goal: Conduct statistical analysis, build regression models, and simulate scenarios.

Day 6â€“8: Statistical Analysis
    Regression Analysis: Trade frequency, commission rates, and net returns.
    Performance Metrics: Calculate Sharpe Ratio, Net Returns.
    Epps Effect: Examine return correlations over time.
Deliverables:
    Statistical summary and key relationships identified.
    Visualizations (scatter plots, regression lines).

Day 9â€“11: Simulation & Scenario Modeling
    Build simulations for varying:
        Trade frequency
        Investment size
        Commission fees
    Compare outcomes across centralized vs decentralized exchanges.
Deliverables:
    Simulation outputs and visualizations.
    Key insights documented.

Day 12â€“14: Theoretical Model Integration
    Bouchaud's Response Function: Model price impact across exchanges.
    Volatility Clustering (GARCH Model): Assess risk-adjusted returns.
    Epps Effect: Validate theoretical predictions with data.
Deliverables:
    Results from Bouchaud's model and GARCH analysis.
    Final visualizations showing trade-offs.

ðŸ“… Week 3: Results & Write-Up
Goal: Organize results and draft the paper.

Day 15â€“17: Write-Up Drafting
    Already on overleaf how to do it (10 pages text and max 15 comprehending images)
Deliverables:
    First full draft of the paper.
    Clear figures and tables.

Day 18: Code Cleanup
    Create a main.py file that:
        Runs the full analysis.
        Has a Boolean switch for demo mode (subset of data).
    Organize folders:
        /data (demo data + README for full dataset link).
        /scripts (preprocessing, analysis, simulation).
        /outputs (graphs, tables).
Deliverables:
    Main code file (main.py) with demo switch.
    README file explaining the folder structure and dependencies.

Day 19: Final Submission
    Double-check:
        Write-up is clean and formatted.
        Code runs without errors in demo mode.
        Dataset links are clearly provided.
